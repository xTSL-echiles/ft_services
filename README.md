# ft_services
You will discover cluster deployment and management with Kubernetes. You are going to do what is called "clustering". The project consists of implementing an infrastructure with different services. For this, we will use Kubernetes, therefore, we will install a cluster that groups several service containers. Each service works in a dedicated container, and the containers have the same name as the associated service. For performance reasons the containers are built on Alpine Linux. To complete the project we need the next components:

Components
* # MetalLB: Is a Load Balancer that manages external access to its services. It is the only entrance to the cluster.

Nginx: Is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

vsFTPd: [very secure FTP daemon] Is an FTP server for Unix-like system, including Linux.

MariaDB: Is a database management system derived from MySQL with a GPL (General Public License).

Wordpress: Is a CMS(Content Managament System) focused on the creation of any type of web page.

phpMyAdmin: Is a free software tool intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the web.

InfluxDB: Is a open-source time series database developed by InfluxData

Telegraf: Is the open-source server agent to help you collect metrics from your stacks, sensors and systems.

Grafana: Is a open-source graphing and analisys software. Allows you to query, view, alert, and explore your metrics from Time Series Database Storage(TSDB)

Technologies
Docker: Is a open-source project that automates the deployment of applications within software containers.

Kubernetes: Is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and handling of containerized applications.

Minikube: Is a tool that lets you run kubernetes locally. minikube runs a single-node kubernetes cluster on your personal computer.

VirtualBox: Is virtualization software for x86/amd64 architectures.

Alpine Linux: Is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox, which aims to be lightweigth and secure by default.
